# TTC 2.0 - Testbench

This repository contains the tests used to validate the developed firmware in the [TTC 2.0 module](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/ttc2). The tests are separated by branches and other drivers, devices, or tasks can vary between different tests since each test is made using current code from the dev_firmware branch.
